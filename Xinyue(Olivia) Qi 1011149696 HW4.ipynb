    "1. What is the process of bootstrapping? \n",
    "The process of bootstrapping is like a redo with the data but have a little difference.For example, if you have a set of data points, like the grades of 10 people. Normally, you just need to analyze that one dataset. But in bootstrapping, you pick people from your original set again, meaning you might pick the same person more than once. And do this several times, for each new sample, calculate the statistic you're interested in, like the average grade. In the end, you have a bunch of averages, which gives you an idea of how much the average might vary if you took different samples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the main purpose of bootstrapping? \n",
    "The main purpose of bootstrapping is to figure out how much uncertainty there is in your estimate.  Let's say you're trying to guess the average grade of all people based on your small sample of 10. Bootstrapping can help you understand how much your estimate value might change if you could take different samples from the population. It's especially useful when you don't know much about the distribution of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you had a (hypothesized) guess about what the average of a population was, and you had a sample of size n from that population, how could you use bootstrapping to assess whether or not your (hypothesized) guess might be plausible?\n",
    "Hypothesis guess is the average grade of a population is 70. And you’ve collected a sample of grades from 50 people. First, you pick the sample and resample it several times. Then calculate the average grade for each time from these resampled data. After this, you’ll have a distribution of these bootstrapped sample means. You can then check if 70 falls within the middle 95% of this bootstrapped distribution. If yes, then your guess is true;  if it lies outside, it might be wrong. "
