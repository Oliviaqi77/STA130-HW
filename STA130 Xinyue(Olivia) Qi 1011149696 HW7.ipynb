    "The low R-squared might indicate that important variables that affect HP are missing from the model. If these missing factors explain a significant portion of the variation in HP, the predictors in the current model will show significance but won't explain much overall.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Nature of the Data: \n",
    "\n",
    "Some datasets have inherent noise or factors that are hard to capture in a model. Even with strong predictors, the model might fail to explain a large portion of the variance in the outcome variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Limitation: \n",
    "\n",
    "The model may only explain a small amount of the variability because the data has inherent noise or the relationships between predictors and HP are not fully captured.\n",

    "Model Building Process and Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n",
    "\n",
    "Before fitting any model, perform an EDA to understand the data, relationships between predictors and the outcome, and any potential multicollinearity or data quality issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with a simple linear regression model and then build incrementally. Add predictors based on their potential to explain the outcome, checking their significance (p-values) and their impact on R-squared.\n",
    "Regularization techniques (like Lasso or Ridge regression) can help reduce overfitting and multicollinearity by penalizing large coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the model's performance using multiple metrics, not just R-squared. Consider using adjusted R-squared (which adjusts for the number of predictors), cross-validation, and residual analysis to better assess how well the model generalizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Building Process: Building Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial Model (model1_spec):\n",

    "Begin by fitting a simple model with Special Defense and Generation as predictors. This can help to understand their individual relationships with HP.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Model Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "After fitting the models, assess the R-squared value to determine how well the model explains the variance in HP. A low R-squared value indicates that most of the variation is not explained by your predictors, even if they are individually significant.\n",

    "Meaning of the Results and Purpose of the Demonstration:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of the Demonstration:\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration is designed to show how the performance of a model can change across different iterations. Since we’re not using a fixed random seed, the way we split the data into training and testing sets will be different each time. As a result, the performance of the model will vary for each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In-Sample vs. Out-of-Sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In-Sample Performance: This tells us how well the model fits the data it was trained on. If the in-sample performance is much better than the out-of-sample performance, it might mean the model is overfitting, meaning it’s too closely tied to the training data.\n",
    "2. Out-of-Sample Performance: This measures how well the model can predict new, unseen data. This is a more realistic measure because it shows how the model will perform in real-world situations, where we don’t have access to the exact data the model was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Randomness:\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is that the randomness in how the data is split into training and testing sets can cause different results, even for the same model and data. This is important because it shows that one single split might not give a true sense of how the model will perform. By running multiple iterations and averaging the results, we can get a more reliable estimate of how the model will perform on new data."
